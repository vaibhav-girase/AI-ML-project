# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning algorithms, assisting medical professionals in making informed decisions.

## Objective
The main objective is to develop predictive models to forecast heart disease risk based on patient data.

## Machine Learning Models
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - Classifies data based on proximity to other data points.
  - Achieved 75.79% accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - Finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.
  - Achieved 76.84% accuracy.
- **Random Forest**
  - Uses multiple decision trees for robust predictions.
  - High accuracy and resistance to overfitting.

## Dataset
Features include age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, splitting datasets, normalizing.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training models and evaluating using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- **KNN Model**: 75.79% accuracy.
- **SVM Model**: 76.84% accuracy.
- **Random Forest Model**: High accuracy and robustness.

## Conclusion
Machine learning algorithms show promise in predicting heart disease risk, aiding early diagnosis and treatment.

## Future Work
